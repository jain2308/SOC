# SOC
I have compiled all the code I have done uptil now in the folder segregated week wise. Each file's name is same as the problems title on platform from which it is taken(codeforces and CSES mostly). I have tried almost all of the problems in the first 3 weeks and then completed nearly half the problems in week 4. for week 5, I just thoroughly went through the theory from book and currently haven't made any progress in practice. I will practice these questions later.
